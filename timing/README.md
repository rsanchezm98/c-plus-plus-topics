# Timing
In this example, there is implemented a timing smart way *timer::Timer*to measure duration of functions in C++. 

## Visual timing 
There is also implemented a *timer::InstrumentationTimer* which writes the timing and threading information in a .json to postprocess it with ![Chrome Tracing](chrome://tracing). You can create different sessions, which means different .json files.
